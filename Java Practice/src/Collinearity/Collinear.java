     * Counts for the number of non-hoizontal lines that go through 3 points in arrays a1, a2, a3.
     * This method is static, thus it can be called as Collinear.countCollinear(a1,a2,a3)
     * @param a1: An UNSORTED array of integers. Each integer a1[i] represents the point (a1[i], 1) on the plain.
     * @param a2: An UNSORTED array of integers. Each integer a2[i] represents the point (a2[i], 2) on the plain.
     * @param a3: An UNSORTED array of integers. Each integer a3[i] represents the point (a3[i], 3) on the plain.
     * @return the number of points which are collinear and do not lie on a horizontal line.
     *
     * Array a1, a2 and a3 contain points on the horizontal line y=1, y=2 and y=3, respectively.
     * A non-horizontal line will have to cross all three of these lines. Thus
     * we are looking for 3 points, each in a1, a2, a3 which lie on the same
     * line.
     *
     * Three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) are collinear (i.e., they are on the same line) if
     *
     * x1(y2−y3)+x2(y3−y1)+x3(y1−y2)=0
     *
     * In our case y1=1, y2=2, y3=3.
     *
     * You should implement this using a BRUTE FORCE approach (check all possible combinations of numbers from a1, a2, a3)

     *  to the equation for finding collinear points and if the result is 0, I increase the collinearCount by 1.
     *  I return the result at the end.
